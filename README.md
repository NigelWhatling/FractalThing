# Fractal Thing

This is a little project that I'm building so that I can play with React things. Learning by doing and all that.

It allows you to browse fractals. Just the Mandelbrot set at the moment. May add more later.

## What are Fractals?

> A curve or geometrical figure, each part of which has the same statistical character as the whole. They are useful in modelling structures (such as snowflakes) in which similar patterns recur at progressively smaller scales, and in describing partly random or chaotic phenomena such as crystal growth and galaxy formation.
> \- [Oxford Dictionary](https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/fractal)

This is most likely a huge over-simplification. The important bit to know for this site is that with the right processing and palettes, we can generate and explore pretty pictures like this:

## The Maths

I'm just going to say that I don't have a deep understanding the mathematics behind fractals. That wasn't the point of building this site. I've lifted the majority of the algorithms from online resources such as:
